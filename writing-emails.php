				<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
                <p>Yo dawg, don't email those instructors like you text your friend, it ain't cool man, it ain't cool.</p>
                <p>Did you notice how unprofessional that last sentence sounded? Your instructors will not like it if you send them emails that sound like a text message to your friends, they expect a professional email from you. A professional email creates a streamlined and concise communication between you and the instructor, show that you are professional and responsible, itâ€™s appropriate for academic and work environments, it gets better responses from your instructor, and it cultivates confidence towards situations where you must communicate electronically to an adult in a professional setting.</p>

                <h2>The Only Professional Email Template You Will Ever Need</h2>
                <p>[Professional Greeting with honorific and name]</p>
				<p>[Polite interest/meaningless niceness]</p>
				<p>[Background information]. [The reason for your email]. [If applicable, explaining that you have tried to do this on your own beforehand]. [Restatement of your request].</p>
				<p>[Thank them],</p>
				<p>[Name]</p>

				<h2>How we will use this</h2>
                <p><em>William</em> - I'm going to be writing a ton of emails in college to my professors, so knowing how to write professionally is key to making sure that they understand me clearly and I look like I am taking the email seriously.</p>
                <p><em>Nicole</em> - Whenever I email someone for school, I am unsure if I am formatting it correctly or professionally in a way that they would like to see. Knowing how to do this will make it easier to know that I am sending the right email.</p>
                <p><em>Raelyn</em> - I will definitely be typing emails to my professors when I have questions I was not able to answer in class and are not on the syllabus. I will also be curating emails when communicating with potential bosses and other professional relationships.</p>
